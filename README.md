# SimplePrintf

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This program does not fully simulate the behavior of the print function. 
This is an exam practice code that I sketched out in 3 hours for practice. 
There is no memory management, no static variables, no repeated iterations along the line, no memory allocation. 
The whole function is performed in one pass</p>
<h3>What this function can do</h3>
<p>Like a printf, it displays the required data in the console, but not all and not completely as a printf. more specifically
<li>data types - hexadecimal numbers, integers, strings</li>
<li>field width specifier</li>
<li>precision modifier</li>
</p>
